# The Equalizer

### Description
When you own a Discord server things can get hectic really fast.

It usually comes down to who you want to be an admin and who you don't. This can be a difficult decision to make, as if you mod only a few people, others might complain that they should be admin. If you mod too many people than it becomes chaos, people moving others in and out of channels when being a sore loser, ect.

The aim for this bot is to be able replace all admins on a discord server. It may also be used alongside admin users, but they would be able to overrule anything the bot decides, so it sort of defeats the purpose.

As of now, the bot is nowhere near where I evision it in the future, but I suppose you have to start somewhere.

### Technical Info

This project is written in TypeScript and makes use of the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) API.

You will need `node.js` to run this bot, and if you decide to attempt to do so, you must create a new bot and define your auth code as `auth` in `options.json`. Before you can start the program, you must first run `npm install` to install dependencies and compile the TypeScript into JavaScript. You may then start the bot with `npm start`
