The `help` command aims to allow any user to understand how each command works. It can be called in several different ways:

- With no parameters. It simply invokes the `list-commands` command.
- With one parameter, a command name. It will show both the description and invocation of the supplied command.
- With two parameters, a command name and then either `description` or `invocation` for the corresponding resource.
