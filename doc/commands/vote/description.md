The `vote` command is used to vote on the current poll. Similarly to the `mute` and `unmute` commands, the `vote` command's scope is the current voice channel as opposed to the current server. Each user in the voice channel may only vote once. There are three types of votes one may cast: an upvote, a downvote, or a neutral vote. Respectively, each type will increment the vote sum by 1, -1, and 0. Should a user want to alter their vote, they may do so by simply running `vote` again with a different value.
